### 🎓 About Me

I'm a recent graduate with a double major in **Physics** and **Mathematics**. My journey has led me from exploring the mysteries of the universe to unraveling the inner workings of Large Language Models. I thrive at the intersection of curiosity, creativity, and rigorous quantitative thinking.

Currently, I'm a **researcher at Aigoverse**, delving into the frontiers of AI and machine learning.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On

- **[Breaking_down_steps](https://github.com/Amanuel-jissa/Breaking_down_steps):**  
  Designing programs that prompt LLMs for detailed reasoning, quantifying and granulating stepwise outputs for deeper insight into model thinking.

- **Gravitational Lensing Simulation & Physics-Informed Neural Networks:**  
  Expanding my college project simulating non-rotating black hole lensing. Now integrating physics-informed neural networks for advanced numerical analysis.

- **Visual Q&A System with HAN:**  
  Building a model that describes images by integrating information from multiple modalities and planning to apply Hierarchical Attention Networks for deeper cross-modal understanding.

### 🧠 Currently Learning & Research

- Applying **graph theoretic lemmas and models** to LLM structures, aiming to unveil patterns in attention maps as a research focus at Aigoverse.
- Exploring new intersections between physics, mathematics, and machine learning.

### 🎸 Fun Facts

- Jazz & classical guitar enthusiast — you’ll find me playing most evenings!
- Sunday afternoons are for baking cakes (and experimenting with new recipes).
- A passionate admirer of poetry, from John Donne and Alexander Pope to Wilfred Owen.
